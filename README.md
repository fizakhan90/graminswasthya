# graminswasthya

A new Flutter project that serves as a starting point for a medical assistant chatbot. This application demonstrates integration of text-to-speech (TTS), speech recognition, and inference using a BioBERT TFLite model for processing user queries.

## Overview

The **graminswasthya** project is designed to help patients communicate with a virtual medical assistant that supports multiple languages. It uses:
- **Flutter** for building the UI.
- **Flutter TTS** for converting text responses into speech.
- **Speech to Text** for voice input.
- **Google ML Kit Translation** for translating non-English queries.
- **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** for running a BioBERT model to process and generate responses.

**Important Note:**  
Due to GitHubâ€™s file size limitations, the BioBERT TFLite model file (`biobert_qa.tflite`, approximately 350 MB) is not included in this repository.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- Git (with Git LFS if you wish to track large files)
- A device or emulator for running the app
